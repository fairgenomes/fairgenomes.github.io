## Motivation

Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) has greatly increased diagnostic yield, enabled choosing the best medicine with least adverse effects, has provided many clinically actionable insights and has dramatically accelerated research into understanding of genotype-phenotype relations. However, even for seemingly easy-to-solve Mendelian disorders only a minority of patients receive a clear molecular diagnosis (30-40%) and there is still limited access to targeted therapy for cancer patients in the Netherlands. The primary roadblock is no longer data acquisition, but data interpretation.

## FAIR genomes

The FAIR genomes project is a national coordination action to unite currently fragmented guidelines & tools to increase ‘FAIR’-ness of DNA data - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability - uniting work from all types of DNA laboratories (rare disease, cancer, research, etc), patients/participants organisations, and has extensive collaborations with (inter)national initiatives, including aligned with NL and international organisations BBMRI, ELIXIR, X-omics, Solve-RD, EJP-RD, GA4GH.

## Tools

The results include a
* standardized semantic data structure,
* ELSI guidelines,
* implementation using CRF and MOLGENIS software,
* integration with NICTIZ national standard organisation,
* and several supporting tools (VARDA, Mutalyzer).


## Implementation

Implementation studies are underway in collaborations with groups and labs from VKGL, NVVP, NVHG, PALGA X-omics/BBMRI-NL, and VSOP.
